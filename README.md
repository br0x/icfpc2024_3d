This is an interpreter of 3D language from [ICFP Contest 2024](https://icfpcontest2024.github.io)

Language description is inside [ThreeD.md]() document, and 13 tasks from the contest are in [Tasks3D.md]()

Some html layout improvements are necessary, but I'm not a frontend guy and this is my first attempt at React/ts/canvas in my life.

Pull requests are welcome.
